### Introduction
Idle is a decentralized protocol dedicated to bringing automatic asset allocation and aggregation to the interest-bearing tokens economy. This protocol bundles stable crypto-assets (stablecoins) into tokenized baskets that are programmed to automatically rebalance based on different management logics.
